<h1>rules: Rules describing building targets</h1>

<hr>

<p>Each file in the <tt><a href="rules/">rules</a></tt> directory
describes makefile rule to build a target.
There are three types of rules:<ol>

<li>Static rules describe a single target.  They are stored in files
named the same as that target.

<li>Pattern rules describe a set of targets.  Currently the only
supported pattern is is dot-extension matching.  Pattern rules are
named <tt>default.EXT</tt>, where <tt>EXT</tt> is the extension to
match.

<li>Default rules describe targets on a try-fail basis - each default
rule is tried until one completes without raising an exception, and
its result is used.  Default rules are named <tt>default=EXT</tt>,
where <tt>EXT</tt> has is unused.

</ol></p>

<p>When a target matching one of the above rules shows up as a
dependancy for another target, the rule will be copied into the
makefile, and makemake will attempt to recursively satisfy all
dependancies of the rule, either with other rules, with files from the
<tt><a href="files.html">files</a></tt> directory, or with source
files.</p>

<p>These rule files are composed of three sections:<ol>

<li>All lines up to the first line starting with a colon (<tt>:</tt>),
if present, are Python commands, and are executed in the Python
interpreter.

<li>The first line starting with a colon seperates the Python commands
from the make commands.  Everything following the colon on that line
is prepended to the list of dependancies.

<li>The remaining lines contain the make commands used to build this
target or pattern.  They will be indented automatically when they are
written out to the makefile.

</ol></p>

<p>The following objects are defined for use in the Python code:
<table border=1>

<tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Type</th> <th>Description</th></tr>

<tr> <td>base</td> <td>Global</td> <td>If this is a pattern rule,
the target filename stripped of its extension, otherwise
<tt>None</tt>.</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>command(cmd)</td> <td>Function</td> <td>Adds the command to
the list of commands for make to execute.</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>dir</td> <td>Global</td> <td>The directory prefix to the
target</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>dependon(item)</td> <td>Function</td> <td>Adds the item
(which may be a list) to the end of the dependancies list.</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>glob(pattern)</td> <td>Function</td> <td>Returns a list of
files matching the given pattern</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>os</td> <td>Module</td> <td>Standard OS module</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>re</td> <td>Module</td> <td>Standard regular expression
module</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>readlist(filename[, dirname])</td> <td>Function</td>
<td>Opens the file, reads its contents as a list of lines, and strips
off all the trailing newlines and whitespace.  If <tt>dirname</tt> is
set, all files in the returned list are prefixed with that directory
name.  All returned filenames are normalized to remove
<tt>dir/../</tt>.</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>string</td> <td>Module</td> <td>Standard string module</td> </tr>

<tr> <td>target</td> <td>Global</td> <td>The filename of the target
of this rule.</td> </tr>

</table></p>

<p>The following string substitutions may be used in either the
dependancy line or any of the make commands following it:<ul>

<li><tt>%(base)s</tt> inserts the target file name stripped of its
extension.

<li><tt>%(deplist)s</tt> inserts a space-seperated list of all of the
dependancies.

<li><tt>%(deplist_pre)s</tt> inserts a space-seperated list of all the
dependancies except for those listed on the dependancy line.

<li><tt>%(target)s</tt> inserts the target file name.

</ul>
In addition, any of the variables created in the Python code section
above may be inserted by the same method.</p>
